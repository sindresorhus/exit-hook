# exit-hook

> Run some code when the process exits

The `process.on('exit')` event doesn't catch all the ways a process can exit.

This package is useful for cleaning up before exiting.

## Install

```
$ npm install exit-hook
```

## Usage

```js
import exitHook from 'exit-hook';

exitHook(() => {
	console.log('Exiting');
});

// You can add multiple hooks, even across files
exitHook(() => {
	console.log('Exiting 2');
});

// Hooks can be asynchronous by telling exitHooks to wait
exitHook(async () => {
	console.log('Exiting 3, wait max 100ms');
}, 100);

throw new Error('ðŸ¦„');

//=> 'Exiting'
//=> 'Exiting 2'
//=> 'Exiting 3, wait max 100ms'
```

Removing an exit hook:

```js
import exitHook from 'exit-hook';

const unsubscribe = exitHook(() => {});

unsubscribe();
```

## API

#### onExit
