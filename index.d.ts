/**
Run some code when the process exits.

The `process.on('exit')` event doesn't catch all the ways a process can exit.

This package is useful for cleaning up before exiting.

@param onExit - The callback function to execute when the process exits.
@returns A function that removes the hook when called.

@example
```
import exitHook from 'exit-hook';

exitHook(() => {
	console.log('Exiting');
});

// You can add multiple hooks, even across files
exitHook(() => {
	console.log('Exiting 2');
});

throw new Error('ðŸ¦„');

//=> 'Exiting'
//=> 'Exiting 2'

// Removing an exit hook:
const unsubscribe = exitHook(() => {});

unsubscribe();
```

	Please see https://github.com/sindresorhus/exit-hook/blob/main/readme.md#async-notes

	When using asynchronous hooks, you should use `exitHook.exit` instead of
	calling `process.exit` directly. In node, `process.exit` does not wait for
	asynchronous tasks to complete before termination.

	import exitHook from 'exit-hook';

	exitHook.async({

		},
		minWait: 100
